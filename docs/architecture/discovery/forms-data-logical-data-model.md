# Forms data logical data model

There is a set of forms provided to users as part of a contingency solution to apply for registration and accreditations.

This describes logical data model for storing data collected through forms for `organisation`, `registration`, `accreditation`

## Converting forms data into logical data model

The data submitted from forms is stored in three MongoDB collections: `organisation`, `registration`, `accreditation`. It's stored as a list of answers from forms and raw submission data as JSON.

Example data from form submissions is available in [Sample form data](../../../src/data/fixtures/).

This data needs to be parsed and stored in the logical model proposed above:

- Fetch all submissions from the organisation collection. Parse required fields (company name, address, etc.)
- Parsing should take into account questions being worded slightly differently across different nation (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) forms
- For each organisation, fetch all registrations and accreditations using the referenceNumber
- Parse required fields from registrations and accreditations (material, site address, etc.). Whether the submission is for a reprocessor or exporter might have to be inferred from the form name
- Generate a unique id using ObjectId for each registration/accreditation
- Link registration ID to accreditation ID using "1st line of address, postcode, material, wasteProcessingType"

### ID generation for registration and accreditation

There were two options considered

1. Generate uuid from "site address, material, wasteProcessingType, form submission time". Form submission time is used to account for duplicate form submissions. This has the advantage of ensuring uniqueness at db level.
2. Generate a random unique id using ObjectId. At code level validation should be done to make sure duplicate ids are not generated for same registrations if form data is replayed.

Option #2 has been chosen as option #1 would make it difficult to evolve list of fields that constitute a unique registration

### Linking registrations to accreditations

There were two options considered for modelling registrations and accreditations:

1. Store both under a single WasteOperations object within the organisation. Waste operations are identified by combination of "material, reprocessor/exporter, site address (line1, postcode)". This means registration and accreditation for the same waste operation are stored together and easy to link. However, the problem is that users can submit slightly different data in registration/accreditation forms. For example, a user provides the first line of address as "171 street" during registration and during accreditation as "171". Users might also submit duplicate forms, in which case data has to be deduplicated.

2. Store registrations and accreditations as separate arrays under organisations. Generate a unique id for registration/accreditation using ObjectId. Automatically link registration to accreditation when "material, reprocessor/exporter, site address (line1, postcode)" matches. When it doesn't match, linking has to be resolved from the admin UI. There has to be logic to ensure any write operation doesn't leave registration to accreditation linkage invalid. For example, site address being updated in registration object.

Option 2 has been chosen as it handles users submitting slightly different data between registration/accreditation and duplicate submissions.

### Site modelling approach

Registrations and accreditations are **not** modelled as children of Site (which itself is a child of Organisation). This design decision is based on the following considerations:

#### 1. Data Integrity and Reconciliation

Reprocessors handling multiple materials at a single site submit multiple forms: `number of materials × 2 (one registration and one accreditation per material)`. Most reprocessors will submit at least two forms.

When address details vary slightly across these submissions, attempting to automatically link them to a single Site entity becomes problematic. Instead, we store the data exactly as submitted and perform reconciliation through the admin UI, preserving the original submission data.

#### 2. Inconsistent Site Concepts Across reprocessors/exporters

- **Reprocessors** have physical site addresses where processing occurs
- **Exporters** operate from ports, which are identified by name rather than physical addresses

If we modelled registrations/accreditations as Site children, we would need two different parent structures:

- Reprocessors: Organisation → Site → Registration/Accreditation
- Exporters: Organisation → Registration/Accreditation (no Site entity)

To maintain consistency and simplicity, registrations and accreditations are linked to a Site entity that is identified by its address details. This provides a cleaner data model while accommodating both reprocessors/exporters and allowing for post-submission reconciliation.

### Status History

The `statusHistory` field tracks all status changes for organisations, registrations, and accreditations. This is particularly important for accreditations to determine if they were active at a given point in time.

#### How It Works

- **Initial creation**: When created, an entry with status `"created"` and current timestamp is added
- **Status changes**: Every time status changes, a new entry is appended with the new status and timestamp
- **Immutable**: Existing entries are never modified, only new entries are added

#### Determining Active Periods

```javascript
// Check if accreditation was active on a specific date
const wasActiveOn = (accreditation, targetDate) => {
  const statusAt = accreditation.statusHistory
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.updatedAt) - new Date(b.updatedAt))
    .filter((entry) => new Date(entry.updatedAt) <= targetDate)
    .pop()

  return statusAt?.status === 'approved'
}
```

### Schema version

Schema changes will be versioned and stored at record level.

### Document version field

The version field will start from 1(insert) then get incremented for every update. It can be used for optimistic locking in future

### Creating new collection

Create a new collection to store combined data from `organisation`, `registration`, `accreditation`. This means original data remain intact if needed.

As organisation collection name is already used, there are two options available

1. rename existing collections to `organisation_forms`, `registration_forms`, `accreditation_forms` and use organisation as new collection name.
   This can be done in straightforward manner with downtime. A bit more involved to deploy renaming without downtime
   One option is to deploy code change to fall back to new name if old name doesn't exist then deploy name change
2. Use epr-organisations for new collection

Option #2 has been chosen as its less risky and taking account of delivery timelines

```

## Assumptions

- System will not deduplicate data across form submissions. Logical data model will store data submitted as its from forms and then potentially update anything incorrect from admin UI.
- Registration needs to be renewed every year, accreditation needs to be applied every year. For now its assumed system is tracking current registration/accreditations and not storing for which year its applicable
- How to model users and their DEFRA logins needs to be investigated separately. Users can potentially be identified by email.id.
  This is relevant when regulator approves registration/accreditation and defra id needs to be created and emailed to them.
  The lineage between defra id and email id(or whatever is decided to link approved person/prn signatory to defra id) needs to be stored.
