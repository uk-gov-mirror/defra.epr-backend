/**
 * Response contract for the published UK reprocessor and exporter tables.
 * Keyed by reporting month, then material, then accreditation type, each
 * type carrying the measures its own table prints, plus the grand total each
 * table ends in. Each month says how many monthly reports it was owed and how
 * many have been submitted, and the period carries the sum, so a page can say
 * how complete the figures are. That count covers the registrations these
 * figures cover, those holding a live accreditation, which is a narrower
 * population than the waste balance counts over.
 *
 * Every row of figures and grand total also carries operator counts, for the
 * regulators to judge whether each figure would identify an operator. An
 * operator is a business, and counts once however many sites it has, so one
 * with sites in two nations counts once in each nation and once in the UK.
 *
 * - `operatorCount` is the operators who could have contributed: every
 *   operator owed a report for the month, whether or not it submitted one, and
 *   every operator whose report the figure includes. A suspended operator
 *   counts. One whose accreditation stood cancelled for the whole month does
 *   not, unless the figure includes a report of its all the same, and neither
 *   does one the figures leave out.
 * - `submittingOperatorCount` is the operators whose reports the figure
 *   includes.
 * - `contributingOperatorCounts` holds, for each figure in the row, the
 *   operators whose reports put something other than zero into it. The
 *   sent-on total takes from any report that sent something on, and the
 *   average price from any that reported revenue or revised tonnage.
